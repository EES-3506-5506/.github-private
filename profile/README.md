For the purpose of this course, we will be using Azure Virtual Machines which I have already configured with the correct conda environment for our purposes. To run the course outside of an Azure VM, the ees3506_5506 conda environment used can be set up with the .yml located [here](https://github.com/EES-3506-5506/.github-private/blob/main/conda_env.yml). This assumes one has miniconda & mamba already installed on their system, if not, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for your specific configuration.
